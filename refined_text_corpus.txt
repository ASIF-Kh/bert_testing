devopedia for developers by developers text corpus for nlp summary discussion what are the traits of a good text corpus or wordlist what are the different types of text corpora for nlp what are the types of annotations that we can have on a text corpus what are some nlp taskspecific training corpora could you list some nlp text corpora by genre what are some generic training corpora for nlp derived from text corpus which datasets are useful for nlp tasks which are some corpora for nonenglish languages are there curated lists of datasets for nlp work where can i download text corpora for training nlp models milestones references further reading article stats cite as datasets can help benchmark a models performance source zhang and wallace table in the domain of natural language processing nlp statistical nlp in particular theres a need to train the model or algorithm with lots of data for this purpose researchers have assembled many text corpora a common corpus is also useful for benchmarking models typically each text corpus is a collection of text sources there are dozens of such corpora for a variety of nlp tasks this article ignores speech corpora and considers only those in text form while english has many corpora other natural languages too have their own corpora though not as extensive as those for english using modern techniques its possible to apply nlp on lowresource languages that is languages with limited text corpora discussion what are the traits of a good text corpus or wordlist its said that a prototypical corpus must be machinereadable in unicode it must be a representative sample of the language in current use balanced and collected in natural settings a good corpus or wordlist must have the following traits depth a wordlist for instance should include the top k words and not just the top k words recent corpus based on outdated texts is not going to suit todays tasks metadata metadata should indicate the sources assumptions limitations and whats included in the corpus genre unless corpus has been collected for specific tasks it should include different genres such as newspapers magazines blogs academic journals etc size a corpus of half a million words or more ensures that low frequency words are also adequately represented clean a wordlist giving word forms of the same word can be messy to process a better corpus would include only the lemma and part of speech what are the different types of text corpora for nlp a plain text corpus is suitable for unsupervised training machine learning models learn from the data in an unsupervised manner however a corpus that has the raw text plus annotations can be used for supervised training it takes considerable effort to create an annotated corpus but it may produce better results a corpus can be assembled from a variety of sources and genres such a corpus can be used for general nlp tasks on the other hand a corpus might be from a single source domain or genre such a corpus can be used only for a specific purpose what are the types of annotations that we can have on a text corpus american national corpus open annotated with pos lemma and noun chunks in xml and standalone form source gries and berez fig partofspeech is one of the most common annotations because of its use in many downstream nlp tasks annotating with lemmas base forms syntactic parse trees phrasestructure or dependency tree representations and semantic information word sense disambiguation are also common for discourse or text summarization tasks annotations aid coreference resolutions for instance british component of the international corpus of english icegb of million words is pos tagged and syntactically parsed another parsed corpus in penn treebank while wordnet and framenet are not corpora they contain useful semantic information audiovideo recordings are transcribed and annotated as well annotations are phonetic sounds prosodic variations or interactional video transcripts may annotate for sign language and gesture annotations could be inlineembedded with the text when they appear on separate lines its called multitiered annotation if theyre in separate files and linked to the text via hypertext its called standalone annotation what are some nlp taskspecific training corpora example questions and answers from squad source squad b here are some taskspecific corpora pos tagging penn treebanks wsj section is tagged with a tag tagset use ritter dataset for social media content named entity recognition conll ner task is newswire content from reuters rcv corpus it considers four entity types wnut emerging entities task and ontonotes are other datasets constituency parsing penn treebanks wsj section has dataset for this purpose semantic role labelling ontonotes v is useful due to syntactic and semantic annotations sentiment analysis imdb has released k movie reviews others are amazon customer reviews of million reviews million business reviews from yelp and sentiment of k tweets text classificationclustering reuters is a collection of news documents from indexed by categories newsgroups is another dataset of about k documents from newsgroups question answering stanford question answering dataset squad is a reading comprehension dataset with k questions plus k unanswerable questions jeopardy dataset of about k qa is another example could you list some nlp text corpora by genre formal genre is typically from books and academic journals examples are project gutenberg ebooks google books ngrams and arxiv bulk data access there are many text corpora from newswire examples are newsgroups and reuters for informal genre we can include web data and emails corpora for these include common crawl blogger corpus wikipedia links data enron emails and ucis spambase corpora derived from reviews include yelp reviews amazon customer reviews and imdb movie reviews even more informal are sms and tweets for which we have sentiment twitter us airline sentiment and sms spam collection spoken language is often different from written language hub english is a dataset thats a transcription of telephone conversations signed language can also be annotated and transcribed to create a corpus since languages evolve when analyzing old text our models need to be trained likewise examples include doe corpus ss and coha ss another special case is of learners who are likely to express ideas differently the open cambridge learner corpus contains k student responses of million words its also common to have domainspecific corpora for example biocreative and genia are for biology what are some generic training corpora for nlp some of the wellknown corpora are brown corpus british national corpus bnc lancasterosloberen corpus lob international corpus of english ice corpus of contemporary american english coca google books ngram corpus penn treebank english gigaword fifth edition and ontonotes release wikipedia was not made for training nlp models but it can be used we would need to strip markup gensim python package has gensimcorporawikicorpuswikicorpus class to process wikipedia data generic corpora are usually suited for language modelling which is useful for other downstream tasks such as machine translation and speech recognition researchers have suggested using project gutenberg ebooks penn treebank of about a million words preprocessed by mikolov et al in wikitext of more than million words and wikitext googles onebillion word corpus provides a useful benchmark derived from text corpus which datasets are useful for nlp tasks wordlists such as list of names or stopwords are useful for nlp work phrases in english pie is another resource to explore distribution of words and phrases its based on the bnc corpus tagsets are essential for pos tagging chunking dependency parsing or constituency parsing dkpro core tagset reference is an excellent resource university of lancaster maintains a multilingual semantic tagset treebanks go beyond just postagging a corpus a treebank is an annotated corpus in which grammatical structure is typically represented as a tree structure examples are penn treebank and christine corpus treebanks are useful for evaluating syntactic parsers or as resources for ml models to optimize linguistic analyzers word embeddings are realvalued vectors representations of words these have improved many nlp task including language modelling and semantic analysis while its possible to learn embeddings from a large corpus its easier to start with downloadable embeddings two sources for downloads are polyglot and nordic language processing laboratory nlpl perhaps by well be able to download pretrained language models and apply it to a variety of nlp tasks which are some corpora for nonenglish languages for machine translation its common to have parallel corpus that is aligned text in multiple languages we mention a few examples aligned hansards of the th parliament of canada containing million pairs of aligned text segments in english and french europarl parallel corpus from of european languages from parliament proceedings wmt ende and wmt enfr a corpus using wikipedia across languages bitexts about million tokens and million sentence fragments an excellent source is opus the open parallel corpus lionbridge published a list of parallel corpora in martin weisser maintains a list that links to many nonenglish corpora are there curated lists of datasets for nlp work a simple web search will yield plenty of relevant results some include download links to the sources we mention a few that stand out linguistic data consortium has a list of corpora grouped by project english corpora hosts nine large corpora the stanford nlp group has shared a list of corpora and treebanks registry of open data on aws stores some nlpspecific datasets nlp datasets at fastai is actually stored on amazon s shared by users dataworld lists nlp datasets shared by users kaggle list wordlists embeddings and text corpora nicolas iderhoffs list of nlp datasets includes collection dates and dataset sizes sebastian ruder tracks nlp progress organized by tasks with links to external datasets martin weisser maintains a list of historical and diachronic corpora in nltk python code call nltkdownload but we can download them separately as well from blogs three separate lists are from cambridge spark lionbridge and open data science where can i download text corpora for training nlp models these are the download links for some notable text corpora brown corpus corpus of contemporary american english coca penn treebank paid data dumps of english wikipedia wikipedia links data project gutenberg ebooks google books ngrams via google or via amazon s bucket arxiv bulk data access common crawl dbpedia knowledge base amazon customer reviews imdb reviews google blogger corpus jeopardy questionanswer dataset yelp open dataset enron email dataset newsgroups sentiment sms spam collection wordnet milestones w nelson francis and henry kuera at the department of linguistics brown university publish a computerreadable general corpus to aid linguistic research on modern english the corpus has million words samples of about words each revised editions appear later in and called brown corpus it inspires many other text corpora the corpus with annotations is included in treebank linguistic data consortium ldc is formed to serve as a repository for nlp resources including corpora its hosted at the university of pennsylvania bnc is a balanced corpus source wikipedia b a million corpus of british english called bnc british national corpus is assembled between and its balanced across genres a followup task called bnc is started in which can help in understanding how language evolves spoken bnc is released in september written bnc is expected to come out in penn treebank is released its based upon the original treebank and its revised treebank ii this work started in at the university of pennsylvania treebank includes taggedparsed brown corpus million words of wsj material annotated in treebank ii style tagged sample of atis and taggedparsed switchboard corpus apart from pos tags the corpus includes chunk tags relation tags and anchor tags the bllip wsj corpus release has million words and supplements the wsj section of treebank collected for the years the corpus of contemporary american english coca is released with million words by december it has million words adding million each year theres good balance of spoken fiction popular magazines newspapers and academic texts its been noted that coca contains many common words that are missing in the american national corpus anc a corpus of million words jun english gigaword fifth edition is released by ldc it comes from seven english newswire services it has billion words and takes up gigabytes uncompressed the first edition appeared in in november researchers at the john hopkins university add syntactic and discourse structure annotations to this corpus after parsing more than million sentences jul from digitized books google releases version of google books ngrams version came out in july only ngrams that appear more than times are included the corpus includes gram to grams it includes many nonenglish languages as well to experiment on small sets of phrases researchers can try out the online google books ngram viewer aug as a corpus for informal genre english web treebank ewt is released by ldc this includes content from weblogs reviews questionanswers newsgroups and email it has about k wordlevel tokens and k sentencelevel tokens its annotated for pos and syntactic structure this includes enron corporation emails from in silveira et al provide annotation of syntactic dependencies for this corpus that can be used to train dependency parsers sep common crawl publishes tib of uncompressed data
